          4 months ago I posted that "Doctors think my Grandads cancer is back" by the title you can tell that he has
          now passed.
          <br>
          He died in his sleep on the 27th of May, the same day his mother died. He decided to stay at home as it was
          certain that this time cancer would get him so he was surrounded by friends and family from the comfort of his
          own chair.
          <br>
          It wasn't a sad death as living got more and more uncomfortable for him that I'm sure death has given him
          peace.

          I'm going to miss the cheeky git.
